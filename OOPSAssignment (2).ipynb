        "# OOPS Assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that encapsulate data and methods. It emphasizes principles like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class containing data and behavior defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Abstraction: Hides the complexity of a system.\n",
        "  - Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods together and restricts direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods are special methods with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, and __add__.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "          class Person:\n",
        "              def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return \"This is a Person object.\"\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is achieved by using private attributes (prefixing with __) and providing methods to access them.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method (__init__) called when an object is created to initialize attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class methods: Operate on the class rather than instance. Use @classmethod.\n",
        "  - Static methods: Do not operate on class or instance. Use @staticmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, default arguments or variable-length arguments are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - When a child class provides its own implementation for a method in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - @property allows you to access a method like an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - It enables code reusability and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class is a class with at least one abstract method (defined with @abstractmethod).\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Code reusability\n",
        "  - Modularity\n",
        "  - Maintainability\n",
        "  - Abstraction and Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - Class variable: Shared by all instances.\n",
        "  - Instance variable: Unique to each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - A class can inherit from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ in Python.\n",
        "  - __str__: User-friendly string representation.\n",
        "  - __repr__: Unambiguous representation for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of super() in Python?\n",
        "  - super() calls the parent class's methods.\n",
